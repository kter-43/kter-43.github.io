# If music be the food of love

Of the many things in life I would be extremely saddened to be without, music would be quite high on the list. I have been a player of many instruments, some with a little more skill than others. I have also tried my hand at writing songs and tunes, again some with more skill than others. Never with sufficient skill to contemplate trying to make a living but with enough to enjoy.

I spent many years doing remarkably little making and considerably more consuming. Still enjoyable but then I got a huge dollop of inspiration from an unlikely or perhaps extremely likely source. My son. He is a very talented musician and seems to have a gift for producing a pleasant noise on almost anything he chooses to pick up. Most of this is focussed on playing the Wombles theme tune, had I but known I may have taught him something else way back when.

**A shared love**

Since realising how much joy he got from music it has reawoken my own enjoyment in playing. I am now making more music in all forms that at any point since my teens. I have even played for paying audiences, albeit as part of a large ensemble. The ability to share some of my efforts was part of the reason I set up this website.

Showcased with this blog entry is my son and I playing a fabulous arrangement by [Christian Morris](https://www.8notes.com/scores/35202.asp). Despite being a tune from preschool that most of us probably sang hundreds of times never thinking much of, this arrangement blends swing style, major to minor tweaks and some well placed harmonies. We loved the sound from our first listen and decided to give it a go.
