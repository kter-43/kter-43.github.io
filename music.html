<h3>Permitted noise since 1900 and typing error</h3>
<p>I am a keen musician, classically taught the clarinet and now enjoying some guitar lessons to try and help
    break the bad habits I taught myself many moons ago. I play with the 
    <a href="https://www.stband.co.uk/">Sevenoaks and Tonbridge concert band</a> as well as Invicta Wind Orcestra. 
    I am also part of the adult volunteers at <a href="https://17th.org.uk/">17th Tonbridge Scouts and Guides Marching Band</a>.
</p>
<p>I have also recently started doing some very basic production level work. I use a combination of Garageband, an iPad 
    and an IK Multimedia iRig HD 2. I don't know if this classes as a recommendation or a "please be gentle". When inspired 
    I sometimes add a music video but several remain as just the audio.</p>
