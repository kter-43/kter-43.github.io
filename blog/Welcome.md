# Hello
Wishing you a very good time of day, whatever that may be, where you are right now. Welcome to this area of cyberspace. This is a pet project that grew. Whatever it was intended to be originally is no more. It is now a random, occassionally currated, collection of things that one man thought he needed.

In here there are things I have found either interesting, annoying or at least in some form noteworthy. There are things I am (un)justifiably proud of. Generally no real purpose to any of it. If you stumble upon something with purpose then I can only apologise and promise it was not intentional. 

Thank you for finding me and bothering to read this.
