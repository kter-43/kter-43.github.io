# Why bother 

The internet is now full of many many people writing many many things many many ways. Much of what is available is
- better written than I could manage
- better informed than I care to become 
- presented with sexier graphics than I will use
- publicised wider and stronger than I will bother.

*so why bother?*

Well my main reason is practice. I have never found writing came naturally, so this is my way of giving me the need to do something about that.

For this reason the posts will rarely have a theme but will hopefully entertain me occasionally.
