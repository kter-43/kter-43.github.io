# Pride and prejudice 

If you had asked me as little as a week ago, which dramatisation of Pride and Prejudice was best I would have said the 1995 BBC version was the best ever and would never be beaten. The cast, music, orchestration and care with which they told Jane Austen's classic love story were a yard stick for period drama. 

However, I find myself writing a review of an audio dramatisation of this Jane Austen classic from Audible. I regularly listen to audio books and drama in the car and stumbled upon this version which I took something of a punt on.

If you have not yet seen or read any of this story I can only say there will be the odd **spoiler** in this post. 

The opening from the 1995 BBC version is the imagined scene where Bingley finds Netherfield and undertakes to rent the property which effectively starts the story. Audible don't feel the need to be quite so fast and loose with Jane's opening but none the less set the story out well and introduce the characters with ease. Audible makes a lot more of the initial dislike Elizabeth takes to Mr Darcy and holds the position with greater more sustain that the BBC needed. This though allows the listener to paint a really powerful image of the scene and this, combined with the narration of thoughts, makes this aspect more 'visual'.  

Jane wrote superb dialogue in her novel so the main interactions between the characters in both the BBC and Audible versions are incredibly familiar as neither dramatist felt the need to deviate hugely in the build up to the first proposal by Mr Darcy. Catherine De Burgh is perhaps a slightly lesser figure for Audible but the performance still manages to capture the steel within the character. 

Once the second stage of the story begins the focus of the two dramatisation shifts more markedly. The BBC version tries to 'act' out the letters that are exchanged between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth and Jane and Elizabeth as would be expected of the TV medium. Audible by contrast let's the words of Mr Darcy and the narrated response of Elizabeth do most of the heavy lifting to set the scene and relies on the listeners imagination a little more. If anything this works for me better although I must confess to Mr Darcy in my imagination looking quite a lot like Colin Firth. 

My favourite scene within the entire book remains the show down between Catherine De Burgh and Elizabeth over whether she has the pretention to aspire to 'quit her sphere'.  I love this scene due to the steadfast responses of Elizabeth and how she remains forcefully firm yet polite. A lesson many of our current politicians might learn from. Civility with a steel backbone is always more admirable than shouting and name calling. This has more made of it in the BBC version when compared with the Audible approach. However, the sense of power and unexpected resistance is still beautifully conveyed. 

The BBC ends the show without letting us know how the 'happy ever after' works out for the non main protagonists which is understandable. However, it is great that Audible found a way to include this within the closure of their dramatisation. 

In summary I loved this audio drama retelling a classic. The cast are superb and the details in the telling are very well observed. If you enjoy books in audio form then this is worth a dabble. Especially if you have never dabbled with audio full cast work. A great introduction to the genre in my opinion.
