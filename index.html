<h3>Chasing fun since I knew what that was</h3>
<p>This website hosts a range of stuff. Some are tools I find useful in day to day life, some are longer term pet projects I 
am (un)justifiably proud of. Some are held here so that when someone asks about that things I do/did then there may be a 
useful record of it easily to hand.</p>
<p>Essentially this is a random, occassionally currated, collection of things that one man thought he needed.</p>
<h4>It's only impossible if you don't try!</h4>
