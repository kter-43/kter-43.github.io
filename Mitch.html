<h4 class="fw-bolder">Hello Mitch</h4>
<p>
    This is the song I mentioned over Patreon. If you have any help tips or thoughts I would really appreciate it as in current form
    I don't think it quite works. However, it feels like it must be a universal experience for anyone who has driven that road and
    as such there must be a way of pulling it finally together. The demo recording below is me shouting at my phone so is poorly 
    recorded with the odd discrpency in the guitar but it didn't yet justify going all the way with a full recording effort yet. 
    All the best
    Jolyon

<h4>Lyrics</h4>
<p>
    Driving out of London down to the west country <br>
    Just passed Basingstoke and leaving the M3<br>
    Traffic is freemoving the miles are flying by<br>
    As I bypass Andover I'm such a happy guy<br>
    Belting out my favourite songs loud and out of tune<br>
    Piling on the mileage so I think I'll get there soon<br>
    Hampshire fades behind me I'm just passing through<br>
    Getting into Wiltshire I see that bloody queue<br><br>
    Chorus<br>
    It's just stones by a road<br>
    Do you have to slow down <br>
    For the stones by a road <br>
    Causing me to frown<br>
    Why do you brake for Stonehenge <br><br>
    
    Were the ancient druids just evil genei<br>
    Knowing where to put their stones to make us want to cry<br>
    Seeing the traffic jam almost every day<br>
    It's not just at the solstice that we get delayed<br>
    Just how they got the stones there I haven't got a clue<br>
    Amazing engineering beside the traffic queue<br>
    So slowly we go past them this sections such a bore<br>
    Despite the mental anguish though it still beats the m4<br>
</p>
